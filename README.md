# FullFile

Program allows users to find car spare parts in full files. Full Files are .CSV files with all service menus for specified markets. We assume that the application executable file will be placed in the same directory ass full files (22 files) so the paths to files are fixed - program gets from user only a car part number (Finis). User also has to specify how many markets will be checked. Application searches thru all rows in every of checked market files and when it finds a row with proper finis than the whole row is copied to new file which is automatically generated by the program.
