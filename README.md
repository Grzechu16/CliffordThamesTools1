# FullFile

  Program allows user to find car spare parts in full files. Full Files are .CSV files with all service menus for specified markets. We assume that the application executable file will be placed in the same directory ass full files (21 files) so the paths to files are fixed - user is asked to type a car part number (Finis) in Text-Field window. User also has to specify how many markets will be checked. Application searches thru all rows in each indicated market files and when it finds a row with proper finis than the whole row is copied to new file. The new file is automatically generated by the program and is located in the same folder.
